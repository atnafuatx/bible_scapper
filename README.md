It is a python script scrapes any version of bible from bible.com. It was made due to inability to find various verisions of Bible online in JSON format.

It follows the following structure:
1. Bible_ESV.json
  1. Book Codes like 'GEN'
    1. 'Chapters'
      1. Chapters by number like '1'
        1. Verses by numbe like 'verse_1'
      2.  'Total' : contains total number of chapters in the book
